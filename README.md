## About

```catfm```, or **C**ompact **A**nd **T**weakable **F**ile **M**anager is an interactive shell for your UNIX system that runs right in your terminal. It not only allows the user to manage files, but to complete complex actions through simple user defined keyboard shortcuts

## Features

* Customizable file formating
* Opening files in your favorite programs
* Script intergration
* Bookmarks
* Tabs
* A customizable bar
* Overall aesthetic customizability

## Dependencies 

* ```go 1.13```
* ```tcell```
* ```bytefmt```
* ```copy```

## Building

**Clone the repository:**

```git clone http://github.com/geremachek/catfm```

**Tnstall go from your distro's repositories:**

**Install tcell:**

```go get github.com/gdamore/tcell```

**Install bytefmt**

```go get code.cloudfoundry.org/bytefmt```

**Install copy**

```go get github.com/otiai10/copy```

**Build the program**

Move into the ```catfm/``` directory and type ```go mod init``` and then ```go build```

**Move the binary to somewhere in your path**

## Configuration

You can configure the program in the ```config/config.go``` file before compiling. This speeds up the program as it doesn't have to read and parse a giant config file everytime you start up the program

I also recommend looking at the [tcell](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell) documentation on [color](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell#Color) and [styles](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell#Style)

### ```cd``` on exit

shell function (put this in your ```.shellrc```):

```bash
fm() {
	catfm && cd "$(< /tmp/kitty)"
}
```
